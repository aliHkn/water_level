Today, I would like to share with you my latest project experience: designing a water level sensor. In this project, I created a highly effective water level sensor using the ULN2003A integrated circuit, and the results were truly satisfying. I want to share this experience with you and perhaps inspire others.

You may already know that the ULN2003A is typically used in driver circuits or stepper motor applications, but this integrated circuit can also be used in simple yet effective electronic projects such as water level sensors. In this project, I utilized the ULN2003A for the purpose of water level detection.

At the core of the project, I needed to use a series of electrodes to detect the water level. Each electrode detects a specific point of the water level and produces a signal. The ULN2003A was used to process these signals and generate appropriate responses.

In conclusion, designing a water level sensor with the ULN2003A was quite exciting, and the results were truly impressive. It was a pleasure for me to share the experiences and lessons learned in this project with other engineers and hobbyists in the electronics community.

Here are the materials I used:
    Various lengths of wires
    1K Ohm resistors x 7
    5mm LEDs in different colors x 7
    9V power supply
